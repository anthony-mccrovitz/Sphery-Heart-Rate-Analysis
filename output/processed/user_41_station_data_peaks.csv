Data density 4.7 points/minute (39.1% of expected). Excessive heart rate variability - 7 peaks detected instead of expected 4-6 stations. Heart rate range 41 bpm with 8.8 bpm standard deviation. Either tracker instability or participant's irregular heart rate during rest periods makes station-level analysis unreliable.,"RESEARCH NOTE: User 41 completed Sphere protocol but heart rate data quality is insufficient for station-level analysis. Detected 7 heart rate peaks instead of expected 4-6 stations indicates excessive variability. Session-level statistics preserved for general cardiovascular analysis: duration 48.8 min, avg HR 129.2 bpm, max HR 152 bpm. Likely causes include tracker instability or irregular heart rate during rest periods. Recommend exclusion from station-level analyses but suitable for session-level cardiovascular trends."
