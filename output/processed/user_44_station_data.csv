Heart rate patterns show clear physiological responses to exercise with well-defined peaks during active gameplay periods and appropriate recovery valleys between stations. TCX data aligns well with Garmin chart visualization. Data is suitable for detailed cardiovascular analysis, station-level comparisons, and physiological research applications.","RESEARCH NOTE: User 44 completed standard 3-station Sphere protocol with high-quality heart rate monitoring. Station boundaries were determined through visual alignment of TCX data with Garmin chart, identifying clear transitions between active gameplay periods and recovery intervals. Each station represents approximately 10 minutes of gameplay with distinct cardiovascular responses. Data is validated for research use in exercise physiology, gaming exertion studies, and cardiovascular response analysis. Station timing reflects actual participant pacing rather than rigid protocol timing, providing ecologically valid data."
