This pattern makes station-level boundary identification unreliable. Heart rate range 82 bpm with significant variability. Long periods of minimal heart rate change in middle section prevent accurate station segmentation.","RESEARCH NOTE: User 69 completed Sphere protocol but heart rate data quality is insufficient for station-level analysis. Peak distribution analysis shows activity concentrated at beginning and end of session with flat middle section lacking clear station boundaries. Pattern suggests either sensor issues during middle portion or unusual activity distribution. Session-level statistics preserved for general cardiovascular analysis: duration 44.1 min, avg HR 135.7 bpm, max HR 163 bpm. Recommend exclusion from station-level analyses but suitable for session-level cardiovascular trends."
