Severe sensor disconnection - extremely sparse data. Heart rate range 101 bpm with 23.4 bpm standard deviation. Maximum recording gap 10.67 minutes indicates sensor connection issues.,"RESEARCH NOTE: User 20 completed Sphere protocol but heart rate data quality is insufficient for station-level analysis. Data density 2.1 points/minute indicates severe sensor disconnection - extremely sparse data. Session-level statistics preserved for general cardiovascular analysis: duration 48.7 min, avg HR 149.9 bpm, max HR 185 bpm. Recommend exclusion from station-level analyses but suitable for session-level cardiovascular trends."
