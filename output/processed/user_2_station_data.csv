All peaks are clearly defined with minimal noise or flat-lining. Time alignment is visually consistent with the Garmin report (PDF) and zone coloring (red/green/blue) reflects realistic physiological responses to gameplay. No major artifacts or sensor dropouts detected.,This session contains 3 distinct stations each with 2 gameplay peaks based on the Sphere study protocol and supervisor confirmation. The cutoffs reflect when the user transitions into active gameplay within each station. Transitions between stations are marked by lower stable heart rate segments.
