Heart rate data is continuous, with clear and distinguishable activity and rest periods. No major data gaps, artifacts, or signal loss were observed. Station segmentation is reliable for analysis.","Station boundaries for this user were defined using a combination of study protocol and visual inspection of heart rate data. Each station start and end was aligned to the beginning and end of sustained HR elevation (red/orange HR zones), corresponding to the active training phases. Transitions were identified based on clear HR drops and lower activity (green zone). Station durations are each ~10 minutes, with transitions slightly longer than protocol, reflecting observed participant rest or delays. Boundaries were manually validated for accuracy."
