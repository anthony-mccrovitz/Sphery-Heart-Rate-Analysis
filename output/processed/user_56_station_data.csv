The HR data exhibit clear, sustained plateaus during each activity block, with well-defined valleys between stations. All station boundaries align closely with real HR peaks and troughs. Minor timing deviations from the protocol reflect authentic participant pacing and are typical for field-based studies. No major data dropouts, artifacts, or misalignments were observed for this session.","Station boundaries for this participant were determined by visually aligning the station windows with the start and end of each sustained heart rate (HR) elevation, as seen in the time-aligned HR trace and protocol-matched PDF report. The start of each station was placed at the onset of a clear HR rise (red/orange plateau), and the end was set at the subsequent sharp HR drop. This approach ensures the analysis focuses on true periods of activity effort, rather than including transitional or rest periods. The third station was extended slightly to capture the complete final high-HR interval. Deviations from exactly 10-minute station durations reflect the participant’s real HR response and protocol adherence on the day of testing."
