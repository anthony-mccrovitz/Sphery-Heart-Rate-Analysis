Session-level heart rate statistics are available but station-level analysis is not feasible. Data may be suitable for general cardiovascular trends but not for detailed station-by-station analysis.","RESEARCH NOTE: User 3 completed Sphere protocol but heart rate monitoring data quality is insufficient for automated peak detection and station boundary identification. Heart rate patterns show excessive noise, gaps, or irregular recording that make station cutoffs unreliable. Session-level data (duration: 42.5 min, avg HR: 167.3 bpm, max HR: 200 bpm) is preserved for general analysis. Recommend manual review of raw heart rate trace and consideration for exclusion from station-level analyses."
