Marked as extremely low-quality session due to data source mismatch.,"User 10's TCX heart rate data appears to be from a completely different session than the Garmin chart. The parsed data shows low, steady heart rates (60-110 BPM) while the Garmin chart shows intense activity with multiple high peaks. This indicates either: (1) wrong TCX file for this user, (2) device malfunction during recording, or (3) data corruption. The data is completely unreliable for analysis."
